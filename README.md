# Stock Analysis
Green stock analysis.

# Overview of Project: Explain the purpose of this analysis.

## Results: Using images and examples of your code, compare the stock performance between 2017 and 2018, as well as the execution times of the original script and the refactored script.

## Summary: In a summary statement, address the following questions.

## What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?

## How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?

To be perfectly frank, VBA doesn't make sense to me. This means my insights are fairly shallow. 

The **advantage** of rafactoring code is efficiency. Depending on the volume of the data, slight improvements in efficiency could save significant time in the long run, especially if the code will be used repeatedly for varying data sets.

The only **disadvanage** I see is that for smaller data sets, it might be a waste of time to refactor code to only shave fractions of seconds off the run time. Losing a day of work to make a code run slightly more efficiently for a small data set might not be the most efficient way to work.

When it comes to this specifict data set, refactoring the data does not feel advantageous. The small fraction of time did not seem beneficial considering the hours spent.
