## Summary of Advantage and Disadvantage of VBA Re-factoring

The **advantage** of rafactoring code is efficiency. Depending on the volume of the data, slight improvements in efficiency could save significant time in the long run, especially if the code will be used repeatedly for varying data sets.

The main **disadvanage** I see is that for smaller data sets, it might be a waste of time to refactor code to only shave fractions of seconds off the run time. Losing a day of work to make a code run slightly more efficiently for a small data set might not be the most efficient way to work.

When it comes to this specific data set, refactoring the data does not feel advantageous. The small fraction of time did not seem beneficial, but for larger data sets, I would see a benefit.
